# Spacelift Ansible Runner Image

This repository contains the Dockerfile for building our default Ansible runner image.

## Quick Start

To use the Ansible runner image, simply update your [stack settings](https://docs.spacelift.io/concepts/stack/stack-settings#runner-image)
to use `public.ecr.aws/spacelift/runner-ansible` as the runner image for the stack.

## Docker Repository

The image is pushed to the `public.ecr.aws/spacelift/runner-ansible` public repository. It is also pushed to the
`ghcr.io/spacelift-io/runner-ansible` repository as a backup in case of issues with ECR.

Altogether we have 3 flavors of the image:

- `public.ecr.aws/spacelift/runner-ansible` - built on top of the [Spacelift Terraform runner image](https://github.com/spacelift-io/runner-terraform), with Ansible installed.
- `public.ecr.aws/spacelift/runner-ansible-aws` - built on top of `runner-ansible`, with `boto3` installed.
- `public.ecr.aws/spacelift/runner-ansible-gcp` - built on top of `runner-ansible`, with `google-auth` installed.

## Branch Model

This repository uses two main branches:

- `main` - contains the production version of the runner image.
- `future` - used to test development changes.

Pushes to main deploy to the `latest` tag, whereas pushes to future deploy to the `future` tag. This
means that to use the development version you can use the `public.ecr.aws/spacelift/runner-ansible:future` image.

## Development

The only requirement for working on this repo is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installation.

### Testing a new Image

The easiest way to test a new image before opening a pull request is to push it to your own
Docker repository and then update a test stack to use your custom image. The following steps
explain the process using Docker Hub, but any other public container registry can be used.

First, sign-up for an account at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), and login via `docker login`:

```shell
docker login
```

Next, build the image using your Docker Hub username to tag it. For example, if your username
is `abc123`, you would use the following command to build the image:

```shell
docker build -t abc123/runner-ansible:latest .
```

Once the build has completed, push your changes:

```shell
docker push abc123/runner-ansible:latest
```

Congratulations! You can now update your stack to use `abc123/runner-ansible:latest` as its
runner image.
